/* This class takes a region of tiles and outputs its edge tiles in more or less sorted order. Sorted in this case
 * just means they carve out a continuous path. 
 * 
 * It was decided to make this class dependent upon a given map (as opposed to being a static class) so that a single
 * visited array could be re-used for every region in the map. The alternatives would be to either create a new giant
 * 2d bool array hundreds or even thousands of times, or to use hash tables which are much slower and have a 
 * much larger memory footprint. */

        /* The following method has some subtleties to it that need to be explained. The purpose of it is to trace out the
         * floor tiles in the room that are adjacent to a wall tile. The tricky part is ensuring that this is done
         * in an orderly fashion, i.e. that it traces out a more or less continuous path (some error is fine, but a random
         * ordering is not, as the ordering of the edge tiles is needed for an enormous optimization in the connectivity
         * algorithm used elsewhere). 
         * 
         * The basic idea is to start on an edge tile, and then perform a depth-first search along edge tiles. The difficulty
         * comes from two situations. First, consider this example:
         * 
         * x x o
         * x x o
         * 1 2 o
         * o o o
         * 
         * x represents wall, o represents floor, numbers represent the path travelled (and the order). If we only 
         * look at horizontal neighbors, the search will terminate at 2, because no adjacent floor is adjacent to a wall.
         * So we need to look at diagonal neighbors. That leads to the following problem:
         * 
         * x x x x
         * x x o x
         * x 3 x x
         * 1 2 x x
         * 
         * The remaining o is not connected to the path so far, but it's diagonally adjacent to the 3. This is handled
         * by explicitly checking for this situation: in order to take a diagonal jump, one of the 
         * two adjacent tiles must be a floor. i.e. one of these situations:
         * 
         * x x x x     x x x x      x x x x
         * x x o x     x o o x      x o o x
         * x 3 o x     x 3 x x      x 3 o x
         * 1 2 x x     1 2 x x      1 2 x x
         *
         * The final complexity is the possibility of the path jumping, leading to irregularities in the edges.
         * Example:
         * 
         * x x o o o 8 x
         * x x 4 5 6 7 x
         * 1 2 3 x x o x
         * o o o x x o x
         * 
         * Ultimately this level of error is accepted as is. */
