/* This is a static class to compute a minimum spanning tree out of a collection of connections (edges). 
 * This implementation uses Kruskal's algorithm which runs in what is effectively linear time.
 * It takes as input edges in a connected graph. It returns a smaller collection of edges such that the resulting
 * subgraph is still connected, but the total distance/weight of the sum of edges is minimized.*/
