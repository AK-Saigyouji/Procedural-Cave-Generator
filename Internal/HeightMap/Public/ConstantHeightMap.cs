/* When generating caves, height maps are optional. This originally resulted in messy code as a result of passing nulls across
 * interfaces. This class was created to address that issue by representing a lack of height map. It can be consumed like a 
 * normal height map (in which case it returns a constant value) but also identifies 
 * itself through the exposed IsSimple property, allowing for a more optimized approach.*/
