/* High level class overseeing the mesh generation system. The generate methods are all written in a thread-safe way, 
 * which is why a custom MeshData class is used instead of Unity's unsafe Mesh class. The Create methods are not thread-safe,
 * as they turn the MeshData classes into Meshes. Responsibility for generating individual meshes is delegated to specific
 * MeshBuilders.
 * 
 * The core algorithm driving mesh generation is Marching Squares, which is implemented in the MapTriangulator class. 
 * It turns a grid of 0s (floors) and 1s (walls) into a collection of triangles representing the walls, but with more 
 * structure than simply putting a square at every 1. 
 * 
 * At the moment this class supports Enclosed and Isometric cave types. Isometric caves are designed with an isometric perspective
 * in mind (hence the name) and thus have ceilings that are built over the walls, not the floors. Enclosed caves are completely 
 * closed off caves designed with a 1st person perspective in mind.
 * 
 * For isometric cave generation, the 1s are triangulated into a ceiling, and the 0s are triangulated into a floor. 
 * Outlines of the ceiling are computed and quads are built to connect the ceiling and floor meshes, giving complete 3D 
 * geometry. Optional height maps then give the geometry added variation by translating the height of floors and ceilings. 
 * 
 * Enclosed cave generation is similar, but instead of triangulating a ceiling, a copy of the floor is made and inverted.
 * Outlines must be inverted since walls face inward for the enclosed caves, rather than outward for the isometric cave.
