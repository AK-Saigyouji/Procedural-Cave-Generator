/* During map triangulation, we process many triangles that have overlapping vertices. In order to avoid seams, 
 * it's necessary to ensure each triangle with a common vertex points to the same vertex in the vertices array.
 * Keeping a generic dictionary for every vertex would work, but that would be both slow and memory-intensive. 
 * To achieve better performance, we can exploit the following observation: a given square can only share its vertices
 * with its immediate neighbours. If we handle squares left to right, bottom to top, this means once we process a 
 * square at x, y, then the only future squares that share its vertices are the squares at (x + 1, y) and (x, y + 1).
 * What this means is that we only need to keep track of two rows at a time: the current one, and the previous one. 
 * 
 * Furthermore, we can perform extremely fast checks by using the fact that we know exactly where to look: e.g.
 * the left-mid point on a square can only be shared by the right-mid point on the previous square on the current row.
