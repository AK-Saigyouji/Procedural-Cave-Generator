/* When converting maps with 1-unit passages into 3d geometry, it was found that they could snag player colliders
 that were exactly 1 unit in radius, and in some cases flat out block the player. This could prove gamebreaking, and
 forcing users of this system to make their agents at least a little smaller than 1 unit was a bit onerous. 
 
  Attempts at trying to create a algorithm to expand tunnels by n for arbitrary integers n proved problematic. 
 They would either be too aggressive, or leave certain cases unaddressed, and generally scaled poorly. Ultimately I 
 decided on a simple implementation which can only expand to a width of 2, but which handles that case very well (no
 unaddressed edge cases, good performance). 
 
  If one requires larger passages then either they can raise the scale, or else use a different algorithm.*/
