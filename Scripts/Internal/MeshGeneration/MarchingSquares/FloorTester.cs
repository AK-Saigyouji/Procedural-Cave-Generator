/* This class is designed to expose critical marching squares information necessary for collision detection to
 * consumers of the MeshGeneration system. Whether for path-finding or simply placing content in run-time, 
 * being able to determine whether an object will collide with walls is an essential piece of functionality.
 * Although there exist general methods to do this without knowledge of the specific geometry, they are orders of
 * magnitude slower and substantially more complicated. This class offers constant-time collision queries for 
 * both points in space and arbitrary boxes of any size. These queries can be used as primitives to design more 
 * complex queries involving meshes and colliders.*/
