/* This class offers methods for testing whether objects will intersect the walls of a cave. Its primary purpose
 is to allow placing content at run-time without knowing ahead of time the structure of a cave. To this end
 it supports various tests for collision which are optimized to allow thousands of executions 
 per frame. To achieve this performance, collisions use axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB), represented in
 Unity by the Bounds struct. These are found on every mesh and collider, and can also be built independently, 
 offering good flexibility and performance at the expense of some accuracy for objects not shaped like 
 boxes parallel to the axes.
 
 Note that we use the efficient primitives from the FloorTester class as the basis behind the functionality in this
 class. */
