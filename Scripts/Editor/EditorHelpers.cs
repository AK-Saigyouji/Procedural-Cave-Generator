/* Editor scripting in Unity is a bit of a mess, with a lot of magic numbers, undocumented features, and
 a less than intuitive API based on .NET reflection. This is a collection of commonly used functionality and 
 constants for editor scripting. Much of the functionality wraps existing functions, providing a more
 intuitive API, albeit one that still has to be used very carefully to avoid errors.
 
  The iteration logic over properties requires some explanation. In the context of editors, a SerializedObject
 represents a serialized stream for an object being inspected. A SerializedProperty, naturally, is a serialized stream
 for a property on such an object. To iterate over the properties of an object, we access an iterator by calling 
 GetIterator on the SerializedObject. On the surface, the iterator works a lot like a normal C# Enumerator, albeit with
 Next and NextVisible (with a bool parameter as to whether the properties of a property should be entered) instead of 
 MoveNext. But instead of having a Current property that points to the current property, the iterator itself is the
 current SerializedProperty. i.e the properties themselves form the chain between all of the properties in the object.
 A significant practical consequence of this implementation is that any reference to a given property becomes invalid
 once we call Next or NextVisible on that property. We could copy every property before returning it, but this would
 result in a lot of garbage being produced just from inspecting objects in the editor. SerializedProperty has an instance
 method Copy specifically for this purpose.
 
  The main upshot of the above paragraph is that one has to be very careful about making assumptions about the state of a 
 given SerializedProperty.*/
