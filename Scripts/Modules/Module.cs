/* Module is an extension of ScriptableObject with similar use cases: modular, swappable assets. The power of modules
 comes from improved capacity for composition. A custom inspector provides access to all modules referenced within a module,
 allowing modification of all modules in its reference graph from a single inspector. Additionally, an added menu item provides
 a deep copy which will make copies of all reachable modules in its reference graph, storing them as assets within the
 copy. These extensions facilitate a more SOLID-friendly approach to the design of modules.*/
