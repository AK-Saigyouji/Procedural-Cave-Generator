        /* Ensuring room connectivity is the most asymptotically expensive part of the map generator, and this method
         * is the reason. The original idea was to consider every pair of edge tiles from each room,
         * settling on the pair with the lowest distance (ensuring optimality). This single method was 
         * responsible for over half the run time of the original cave generator for smaller maps, and completely 
         * dominated for larger maps. The current version is over 1000 times faster (8ms versus 18000ms) than the
         * original method for a medium size map.
         * 
         * To optimize, a small amount of error was accepted, based on the following observation:
         * the larger the distance between the rooms, the more slack can be given in terms of finding a 
         * suboptimal connection. e.g.finding a 300 tile connection versus a 280 tile connection isn't an issue, but finding 
         * a 2 tile connection versus a 22 tile connection is problematic. So each time we compute a distance, we skip a 
         * number of tiles comparable to the computed distance. This ensures that we don't waste time at large distances but 
         * are more careful as the tiles get closer (even if we compute a large initial distance, it is possible that the 
         * rooms are very close elsewhere else). The reason this results in minimal error is that in the optimal case 
         * (i.e. where the shortest connection is always found) the average optimal distance of the selected
         * connections is independent of the map size, and is about 3-6. So if we compute a distance between a pair of 
         * tiles of 20, then we're almost guaranteed to be 20+ tiles away from a connection that would actually get chosen.
         * Exceptions to this are statistically anomalous, and in those cases, the damage is minimal anyway.
