        /* Ensuring room connectivity is the most computationally involved part of the of the map generator and this 
         * algorithm constitutes the majority of the work for this purpoes. The original idea was to consider every pair 
         * of edge tiles, settling on the pair with the lowest distance (ensuring optimality). This single method was 
         * responsible for over half the run time of the original cave generator for smaller maps, and completely 
         * dominated for larger maps. The current version is over 1000 times faster (8ms versus 18000ms) than the
         * original method.
         * 
         * To optimize, a small amount of error was accepted. The following observation was used:
         * the larger the distance between the rooms, the more slack can be given in terms of finding a 
         * suboptimal connection. e.g.finding a 300 tile connection versus a 280 tile connection isn't an issue, but finding 
         * a 2 tile connection versus a 22 tile connection is problematic. So each time we compute a distance, we skip a 
         * number of tiles comparable to the computed distance. This ensures that we don't waste time at large distances but 
         * are more careful as the tiles get closer (even if we compute a large initial distance, it is possible that the 
         * rooms are very close elsewhere else).
